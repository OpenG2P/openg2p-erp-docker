        transaction management in Odoo.

        This mixin is useful for long-running operations and helps to
        avoid deadlocks.

        For example, you may write code like following in some scheduler:

            for record in records:
                with record._in_new_transaction() as nrec:
                    nrec._lock_for_update()
                    # do your long-runnning operation and be sure, that if
                    # record was precessed successufully changes will be
                    # commited.
